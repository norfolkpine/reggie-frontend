© Australian Securities and Investments Commission June 2022 Page 23 
RG 104.78 The ASIC protocol requires a recruiting licensee to request a reference(s) 
about a prospective representative from the representative's current and/or 
former AFS licensee(s) and/or credit licensee(s). AFS licensees and credit 
licensees that receive a request for a reference under the ASIC protocol must 
share information with the recruiting licensee by providing a reference about 
the prospective representative. 
RG 104.79 The ASIC protocol provides a template reference request which asks for 
information about a prospective representative in the past five years. It also 
provides a template consent form which must be completed by the 
prospective representative before a recruiting licensee requests a reference. 
Note: For more information about the obligations that apply under the ASIC protocol, 
see INFO 257. 
Measures for monitoring and supervision 
RG 104.80 Your measures for monitoring and supervision will normally show how you: 
(a) keep track of who your representatives are, what role they perform and 
whether they are appropriately authorised; 
(b) ensure your representatives (including your authorised representatives) 
act within the scope of what you have authorised them to do; 
(c) ensure your representatives understand your compliance arrangements; 
(d) monitor your representatives' compliance; and 
(e) respond to compliance failures. 
Training and competence 
RG 104.81 The obligation to ensure your representatives are trained and competent 
applies only in relation to your representatives who provide financial 
services. 
RG 104.82 We expect you to: 
(a) identify the knowledge and skills your representatives need to 
competently provide your financial services;  
(b) ensure that they have the necessary knowledge and skills;  
(c) ensure that they undertake continuing training programs to maintain and 
update their knowledge and skills; and 
(d) maintain a record of the training they have undertaken (this is required 
under reg 7.6.04(1)(d)).",
