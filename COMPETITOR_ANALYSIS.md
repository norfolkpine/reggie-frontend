# Competitor Analysis: Langdock Pricing

## Overview

Langdock's pricing model is a hybrid of per-user and usage-based pricing, with a clear separation between their core chat product and their workflow automation feature. This allows them to cater to a wide range of customers, from small teams to large enterprises.

## Core Product: Chat & Assistants

The base subscription is "Chat & Assistants," which is priced on a per-user, per-month basis.

### Tiers

*   **Trial:** A 7-day free trial with no credit card required. This is a great way to let users experience the platform before committing.
*   **Business:** €20 per user/month. This tier includes all features, including SSO/SCIM/SAML, and is suitable for up to 1,000 users.
*   **Enterprise:** Custom pricing for organizations with over 1,000 users. This tier offers dedicated deployment options and custom support.

### AI Models

Langdock offers two models for AI usage:

*   **Included:** The Business plan appears to bundle AI model usage into the per-user price.
*   **Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK):** Users can provide their own API keys, which gives them more flexibility and allows them to take advantage of their own negotiated rates with model providers.

## Workflows

Workflows are priced separately from the core "Chat & Assistants" product, on a per-workspace, per-month basis.

### Tiers

*   **Starter:** Included with the "Chat & Assistants" subscription. This tier provides 2,500 workflow runs per month, which is a great way to encourage users to explore the feature.
*   **Business:** €449 per workspace/month. This tier is designed for companies that are operationalizing workflows and includes 40,000 workflow runs per month.

### AI Model Usage in Workflows

AI model usage within workflows is billed separately, based on the model provider's API pricing plus a 10% surcharge. This is a smart way to pass on the variable costs of AI usage to the customer.

## API

Langdock also offers a unified API for all models, with a usage-based pricing model. They charge a 10% surcharge on top of the model provider's price.

## Key Takeaways for Opie AI

*   **Hybrid Pricing Model:** A combination of per-user and usage-based pricing can be very effective.
*   **Separate Pricing for Core vs. Advanced Features:** Separating the pricing for core chat features and advanced features like workflows can help to capture more value from power users.
*   **"Bring-Your-Own-Key" Option:** Offering a BYOK option can provide flexibility and attract customers who already have relationships with AI model providers.
*   **Surcharge on API Usage:** A surcharge on API usage is a common and effective way to monetize API access.
*   **Clear Tiering:** Clear feature differentiation between tiers is crucial for guiding customers to the right plan.
*   **Freemium/Trial Model:** A free trial or a free tier with limited usage is a great way to lower the barrier to entry and attract new users.
